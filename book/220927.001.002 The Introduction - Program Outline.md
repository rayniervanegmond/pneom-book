# 001.002 The Introduction - Program Outline

The primary material in the program is organized in such a manner that it builds generic capabilities around the use of satellite remote sensing data and imagery and climate model information. 

The main parts of the course material are:

* an introduction into the structure and material of the course itself so that the student may quickly find information and sample methods and techniques as needed.
* a description of the various sources of information that the student might consult to support inquiries in specific research questions.
* a description of the physics behind the various types of remote sensing technologies and their relevance for particular reserch questions.
* an introduction into the various areas of interest that were used to organize the domain specific approaches of research and more details about each area of interest.

Then the material in the course proceeds with hands-on tutorials and exercises pertaining to each of the areas of interest. This addresses the specific types of data and information extracted from the available sources. Each of the chapters in the level 001-sections from the introduction are addressed in detail and this is where research question specific methods and techniques and analysis approaches are discussed.
